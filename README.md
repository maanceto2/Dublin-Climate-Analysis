# Dublin-Climate-Analysis

 ( Analysis of Dublin's Climate over the period of 1942-2024 )

 This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and climate data for analyzing the climate patterns of Dublin, Ireland. My goal is to provide insights into the historical and current climate trends in Dublin, leveraging various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries.

 ## Project Overview

 Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and understanding local climate patterns is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project aims to:

 * **Collect and preprocess climate data**: I gathered data from Met Ã‰ireann, a reliable source, including temperature, precipitation, and other relevant climate variables.

 * **Analyze climate trends**: Using Pandas, I identify significant trends and anomalies in the climate data.

 * **Visualize findings**: I create informative visualizations with Seaborn to help communicate the findings.
