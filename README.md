# Climate Data Analysis of Dublin Using Pandas, Seaborn, and Dash

 ( Analysis of Dublin's Climate over the period of 1942-2024 )

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks and climate datasets focused on analyzing Dublin's historical and current climate patterns. The goal is to provide insights into Dublin's evolving climate trends through data analysis and visualization, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Dash. 


 ## Project Overview

 Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and understanding local climate patterns is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project aims to:

 * **Collect and preprocess climate data**: I gathered data from Met Ã‰ireann, a reliable source, including temperature, precipitation, and other relevant climate variables.

 * **Analyze climate trends**: Using Pandas, I identify significant trends and anomalies in the climate data.

 * **Visualize findings**: I create informative visualizations with Seaborn to help communicate the findings.
